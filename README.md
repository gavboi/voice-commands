# voice-commands
Random commands controlled by voice

## Usage

Run `voice_recognition.py [name]`. Provide `name` if you want to use another keyword other than the default: "computer". Starting a phrase with `name` will tell the script to attempt to process what you say as a command.

### Commands

#### Write a Note
Tell `name` to "write" something, and it will create a text file with that in it.

## Notes

You seem to need a not terrible microphone for it to work with any consistency.
